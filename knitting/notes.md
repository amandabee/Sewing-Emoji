Because knitting is a labor intensive project there are lots of opportunities to combine it with other emoji to tell a story. 


Knitting is consistently one of the top emoji requests, as noted in [2016](http://blog.emojipedia.org/top-emoji-requests-2016/) and [2017](http://blog.emojipedia.org/top-emoji-requests-2017/).

## Existing Emoji

Possible proposal? https://yarnemoji.com/

Currently, there are no yarn or fiber-art related emojis in use by major platforms. There is a released app (Craftmoji) which supplies craft stickers/imagery (though not as keyboard-accessible emoji).

## History



+ History https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_knitting


Because the simplest knitting needle is indistinguishable from a sharpened stick, and the earliest material that humans would have knit with are all plant or animal based and quick to decompose, we know very little about the history of knitting.

The verb "to knit" was not added to the Oxford English Dictionary until the 1400s [cite](http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEspring06/FEAThistory101.html), but knitting is still a hugely important textile production process.
The oldest known example of a knitted object dates back to [11th century Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_knitting#cite_note-2) but the complexity of the design of those ancient Egyptian socks suggest that knitting was not new then.

## Expected Usage Level

### Frequency
There is a very high expected frequency of use, within a worldwide community. The practice of fiber arts in general (including knitting and crochet) is not limited geographically. Ravelry, the largest and most prominent online community of “knitters, crocheters, designers, spinners, weavers and dyers” has over 6.5 million registered users. Reddit has thriving fiber communities, with countless spinoffs.

  - Knitting (56k+ subscribers)
  - Crochet (50k+ subscribers)
  - Sewing (58k+ subscribers)

### Multiple Use
- Can be used to convey a wide spectrum of fiber arts as previously described (crochet, knitting, weaving, spinning, etc).
- The word “yarn” can also may be used to tell a story or narrative, indicate a tangled or tricky situation.

### Emotional Content
Practices like knitting and crochet are generally regarded to be meditative, and hailed as benefitting one’s mental health, reducing stress levels, and improving hand-eye coordination and focus.

### Image distinctiveness
A yarn emoji would be fully distinct from current emojis. The closest, sadly, would be the “spaghetti” or “steaming bowl” emojis, only similar for the pasta/noodles’ thread-like appearance.

### Completeness
The yarn emoji would go a very long way toward closing a giant hole in the current selection of available crafting-related emoji -- of which, arguably, there is only one -- “artist palette”.
