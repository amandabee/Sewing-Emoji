# Sewing-Emoji
Working out my scheme for some textile related emoji, because it bugs me that there are none. 

I'm working with Emojination to develop four proposals:

+ needle and thread
+ spool of thread
+ ball of yarn with knitting needles
+ safety pin


My original list was something like this:

+ sewing needle 
+ spool of thread
+ knitting needles
+ ball of yarn
+ crochet hook
+ safety pin

With a side list that I wasn't sure I could picture as emoji but seemed relevant and universal:

+ loom
+ sewing machine
+ something that reflects dye?
+ fabric (a bolt of fabric?)
