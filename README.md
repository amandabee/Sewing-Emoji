The Unicode Consortium approved  ðŸ§µ[THREAD](https://emojipedia.org/spool-of-thread/),ðŸ§¶ [YARN](https://emojipedia.org/ball-of-yarn/), ðŸ§·[SAFETY PIN](https://emojipedia.org/safety-pin/) for the 2018 emoji characterset release. You can use them on Twitter and iOS now. No telling when Android phones will catch up. ðŸ˜¿

The SEWING NEEDLE was set aside in 2018 because the emoji sub-committee felt that it duplicated THREAD and that it wasn't visually distinctive. We worked with an illustrator to revise the image and I expanded the NEEDLE proposal to articulate clearly why it belongs in the character set. That proposal was accepted and the needle and thread will be part of [Unicode 13](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2019/19088-needle-emoji.pdf) which will start appearing on devices in late 2020. The final proposal lives at:

# Textile Emoji

I was frustrated that I couldn't represent anything about the production or repair of clothing in emoji. I made a list of possible fiber arts emoji that started out something like this:

+ sewing needle 
+ ðŸ§µ spool of thread
+ knitting needles *are too specific, and yarn captures enough of the concept. 
+ ðŸ§¶ ball of yarn
+ crochet hook *is probably too specific and doesn't have enough other uses to be a widely used emoji. Yarn captures enough of the concept.*
+ ðŸ§· safety pin
+ measuring tape *is still a good idea, tbh.*
+ button *is still a good idea, tbh.*
+ zipper *is still a good idea, tbh.*
+ thimble *is still a good idea, tbh.*

These also seemed relevant and universal but I couldn't really picture any of them as emoji:

+ loom
+ sewing machine
+ spinning wheel
+ something that reflects dye?
+ fabric (a bolt of fabric?)

I can update this with more detail about the process, but someone, somewhere has to tell me they're actually interested. You can listen to Amberley and I talk about the process though, on [The Frontside](https://frontside.com/podcast/112-language-formation-with-amanda-hickman-and-amberley-romo/).
