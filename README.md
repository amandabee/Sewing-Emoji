# Sewing Needle

The SEWING NEEDLE was set aside because the emoji sub-committee felt that it duplicated THREAD and that it wasn't visually distinctive. We worked with an illustrator to revise the image and I've been working on expanding the NEEDLE proposal to articulate clearly why it belongs in the character set. 

The most recent version of the new proposal lives at:

## How to Help?

If you have **compelling arguments** that aren't already well made in that document, you can [share them as issues](https://github.com/amandabee/Sewing-Emoji/issues) here or add a comment to the document itself. And if you can identify **idioms and phrases** featuring the NEEDLE please share them! They don't have to be in English, and the more international idioms we can identify the more compelling the argument is. Again, add them as issues or comment on the proposal. Any **non-sewing implications** for a needle would be great, to make the case that this emoji has wide uses beyond sewing. Any interesting celebrations, like Èáù‰æõÈ§ä the Festival of Broken Needles, are fantastic additions. 

# Craft Emoji

UPDATE: The Unicode Consortium approved  üßµ[THREAD](https://emojipedia.org/spool-of-thread/),üß∂ [YARN](https://emojipedia.org/ball-of-yarn/), üß∑[SAFETY PIN](https://emojipedia.org/safety-pin/) for the 2018 emoji characterset release. You can use them on Twitter and iOS now. No telling when Android phones will catch up. üòø



Working out my scheme for some textile related emoji, because it bugs me that there are none. I'm working with [Emojination](http://www.emojination.org/) to develop four proposals:

+ needle and thread
+ spool of thread
+ ball of yarn with knitting needles
+ safety pin

## Help! Seriously ... I can't do this alone.

A [successful proposal](http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2016/16024-dumpling-emoji.pdf) includes quite a bit of context and history, as well as a design. Emojination has some designers (though if you'd like to work on this definitely let me know!) they can put on the task, but I need help researching some of the context if I'm going to have this done by July 1. Yes, July 1 is the proposal deadline. So can you help me research questions like ...

* Have any existing platforms (which platforms? TK!) built this emoji in, custom? (So far I'm pretty sure they haven't)
* What is the history of the object?
* Would this emoji have other, extra, alternate uses? (Eg. a safety pin sometimes appears as a diaper pin or nappy pin; a needle and thread might represent sutures, quilting, tailoring, or mending)
* Usage/analytics -- do we have reason to believe that anyone will actually use this?

There are a few ways that you can help, especially if you're game to do some research. If you already know how to create a pull request, I'll take research in pull request form. But that's obviously not for everyone. Most folks will want to either edit the notes directly or [file an issue](https://github.com/amandabee/Sewing-Emoji/issues). To do either of those things, you need to create [a github account](https://github.com/). 

## Some Background

My original list was something like this:

+ sewing needle 
+ spool of thread
+ knitting needles
+ ball of yarn
+ crochet hook
+ safety pin
+ measuring tape
+ button
+ zipper
+ thimble

With a side list that I wasn't sure I could picture as emoji but seemed relevant and universal:

+ loom
+ sewing machine
+ spinning wheel
+ something that reflects dye?
+ fabric (a bolt of fabric?)
