# Sewing-Emoji
Working out my scheme for some textile related emoji, because it bugs me that there are none. 

I'm working with Emojination to develop four proposals:

+ needle and thread
+ spool of thread
+ ball of yarn with knitting needles
+ safety pin

## Help!
For each icon, I need a design (though I may have one soon) and I need help researching and brainstorming the following:

* have any existing platforms (which platforms? TK!) built this emoji in, custom?
* what is the history of the object?
* would an emoji have other, extra, alternate uses?
* usage/analytics (guidelines TK)

There are a few ways that you can help, especially if you're game to do some research. If you already know how to create a pull request, I'll take research in pull request form. But that's obviously not for everyone. Most folks will want to either edit the notes directly or [file an issue](https://github.com/amandabee/Sewing-Emoji/issues). To do either of those things, you need to create [a github account](https://github.com/). 

## Background

My original list was something like this:

+ sewing needle 
+ spool of thread
+ knitting needles
+ ball of yarn
+ crochet hook
+ safety pin
+ measuring tape
+ button
+ zipper
+ thimble

With a side list that I wasn't sure I could picture as emoji but seemed relevant and universal:

+ loom
+ sewing machine
+ something that reflects dye?
+ fabric (a bolt of fabric?)
