# Sewing-Emoji
Working out my scheme for some textile related emoji, because it bugs me that there are none. 

I'm working with Emojination to develop four proposals:

+ needle and thread
+ spool of thread
+ ball of yarn with knitting needles
+ safety pin

## Help!
For each icon, I need a design (though I may have one soon) and I need help researching and brainstorming the following:

* have any existing platforms (which platforms? TK!) built this emoji in, custom?
* what is the history of the object?
* would an emoji have other, extra, alternate uses?
* usage/analytics (guidelines TK)


## Background

My original list was something like this:

+ sewing needle 
+ spool of thread
+ knitting needles
+ ball of yarn
+ crochet hook
+ safety pin

With a side list that I wasn't sure I could picture as emoji but seemed relevant and universal:

+ loom
+ sewing machine
+ something that reflects dye?
+ fabric (a bolt of fabric?)
