# Needle and Thread

This is very badly worded ...
Though clothing is a core element of humankind's protection from the elements and civilization and the core tool for creating clothing is nearly universal, the emoji character set includes no sewing related emoji. This proposal seeks to fill that gap. 

## synonyms
mending, sewing, quilting, tailoring, sutures, stitches, tapestry

## Other Uses
By some accounts, the sewing needle pre-dates human history. The [oldest known sewing needle](http://siberiantimes.com/science/casestudy/news/n0711-worlds-oldest-needle-found-in-siberian-cave-that-stitches-together-human-history/) is 50,000 years old and predates homo sapiens. The basic design has changed very little in that time though we can now use needles in a wide range of sizes.

The needle and thread is as useful for sewing sutures to close a wound, as it is for mending pants, tailoring a suit, embroidering a pillowcase, tatting lace, tapestry work, and darning stockings. Humans use needles to stitch together silk kerchiefs, cotton shirts, leather saddles and canvas sails. 

The needle and thread is as much a symbol of do-it-yourself resiliance as it is of couture tailoring and fine fashion.

+ mending -- generally connotes DIY resiliance
+ quilting
+ surgery / sutures
