Quilt pin, kilt pin, diaper pin, nappy pin

## Other pins

The 📍 and 📌 pushpin and map pin options are both forms of pin, but they are distinct from the self closing safety pin. The 📎🖇paperclip emojis are often used to indicate "holding things together" even when those things would be better held by a safety pin. 

## Other Uses

The safety pin represents emergeny repair, prototyping. 

A large safety pin is used as a [kilt pin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilt_pin#cite_ref-four_4-1) in less formal settings. Many generations of diapers were held together with safety pin. 

The safety pin is a versatile symbol. It was and is closely associated with [punk](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/inside-the-mets-new-exhibit-punk-chaos-to-couture-20130507/pin-it-down-0787285) fashion. In 2016, the Safety Pin emerged briefly as a symbol of anti-racist solidarity [in the US](http://kottke.org/16/11/safety-pins-as-a-symbol-of-solidarity-against-racism) and [in the UK](https://thinkprogress.org/after-brexit-a-safety-pin-becomes-a-symbol-of-solidarity-with-immigrants-8b6a152fe046). 

Sewing and Knitting are among the top emoji requests, at least in [2016](http://blog.emojipedia.org/top-emoji-requests-2016/) and [2017](http://blog.emojipedia.org/top-emoji-requests-2017/)

## History

The precursor to the safety pin was probably the self closing Fibula Prenestina, a golden brooch that likely dates to the 7th century. The dates are [in dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praeneste_fibula), but we know that a man named Walter Hunt [patented the safety pin](https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/news-updates/patent-safety-pin-issued-april-10-1849-new-yorker-invents-handy-device) in 1849
