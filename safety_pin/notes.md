Clasp pins existed before, but Hunt's innovation utilized a single piece of metal (for easier fabrication), implementing a spring instead of a hinge, and combining the spring with a clasp. His patent application promised there would be no danger of "bending the pin, or wounding the fingers."

## Synonym
Quilt pin, kilt pin, diaper pin, nappy pin

## Other pins

The üìç and üìå pushpin and map pin options are both forms of pin, but they are distinct from the self closing safety pin. The üìéüñápaperclip emojis are often used to indicate "holding things together" even when those things would be better held by a safety pin. 

With the exception of a spike in the fall of 2016, when the safety pin emerged briefly as a symbol of anti-racist solidarity [in the US](http://kottke.org/16/11/safety-pins-as-a-symbol-of-solidarity-against-racism) and [in the UK](https://thinkprogress.org/after-brexit-a-safety-pin-becomes-a-symbol-of-solidarity-with-immigrants-8b6a152fe046), the safety pin has remained more prominent than the thumbtack and close to the paperclip:

The safety pin is a versatile symbol. In the Ukraine, pinning safety pins to the inside of a child‚Äôs clothing will ward off evil spirits. In other parts of Europe finding a safety pin is good luck, and a portent of good fortune.[1](http://museumofeverydaylife.org/exhibitions-collections/current-exhibitions/a-visual-history-of-the-safety-pin

 It was and is closely associated with [punk](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/inside-the-mets-new-exhibit-punk-chaos-to-couture-20130507/pin-it-down-0787285) fashion starting in the 1970s.

## Existing Emoji

## Conflict
A search of the [WIPO Trademark Database](http://www.wipo.int/branddb/en/) for logos with "Image Class: VC.09.05.09" (or "safety pin") turns up two hundred different logos that incorporate a safety pin. 

## History

The precursor to the safety pin was probably the self closing Fibula Prenestina, a golden brooch that likely dates to the 7th century. The dates are [in dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praeneste_fibula), but we know that a man named Walter Hunt [patented the "dress" pin](https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/news-updates/patent-safety-pin-issued-april-10-1849-new-yorker-invents-handy-device) in 1849 -- other "safety pin" patents had been submitted but Hunt's patent is the safety pin we use today.
